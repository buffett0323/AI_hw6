Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nYou are a helpful assistant chatbot.\n\n### Input:\nExplain why college students should get a library card.\n\n### Response:\nA library card is a valuable resource for college students, as it provides access to a wealth of information and resources that can be invaluable for academic success. Here are some reasons why college students should get a library card:\n\n1. Access to a wide range of resources: College libraries typically have a vast collection of books, journals, magazines, and other resources that can be used for research and academic purposes. With a library card, students can easily access these resources and use them to support their studies.\n\n2. Access to online resources: Many libraries now offer online resources such as e-books, databases, and online journals. With a library card, students can access these resources from anywhere, at any time, making it easier to complete assignments and research projects.\n\n3. Access to technology: Many libraries now offer access to technology such as computers, printers, and scanners. With a library card, students can use these resources to complete assignments and projects, and even print out important documents.\n\n4. Access to events and workshops: Many libraries offer events and workshops that can be beneficial for students. These events can cover a wide range of topics, from academic writing to career development. With a library card, students can easily attend these events and learn new skills and information that can be useful for their studies.\n\n5. Access to a quiet study space: College libraries are often a quiet and peaceful place to study. With a library card, students can use the library as a study space, away from the distractions of their dorm rooms or other areas on campus.\n\nIn conclusion, a library card is a valuable resource for college students, providing access to a wide range of resources, online resources, technology, events and workshops, and a quiet study space. By obtaining a library card, students can enhance their academic success and gain access to valuable resources that can support their studies."

If an automobile rounds this curve at 30 m/s, what is the minimum coefficient of static friction needed between tires and road to prevent skidding?\n\n### Response:\nThe minimum coefficient of static friction needed between tires and road to prevent skidding is 0.25.\n\nTo calculate the minimum coefficient of static friction, we need to consider the centripetal acceleration of the vehicle and the maximum static friction force that can be exerted by the tires.\n\nThe centripetal acceleration of the vehicle is given by the formula:\n\n$$a_{c} = \\frac{v^{2}}{r}$$\n\nwhere:\n\n- $v$ is the speed of the vehicle (in this case, 30 m/s)\n- $r$ is the radius of the curve (120 m)\n\nTherefore, the centripetal acceleration is:\n\n$$a_{c} = \\frac{30^{2}}{120} = 1.25 \\frac{m}{s^{2}}$$\n\nThe maximum static friction force that can be exerted by the tires is given by the formula:\n\n$$F_{s} = \\mu_{s}N$$\n\nwhere:\n\n- $\\mu_{s}$ is the coefficient of static friction between tires and road\n- $N$ is the normal force exerted by the road on the tires\n\nThe normal force is equal to the weight of the vehicle, which is given by the formula:\n\n$$N = mg$$\n\nwhere:\n\n- $m$ is the mass of the vehicle\n- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2)\n\nTherefore, the maximum static friction force is:\n\n$$F_{s} = \\mu_{s}mg$$\n\nTo prevent skidding, the centripetal acceleration must be less than or equal to the maximum static friction force. In other words, we need to find the minimum value of $\\mu_{s}$ that satisfies the following inequality:\n\n$$a_{c} \\leq F_{s}$$\n\nSubstituting the values for $a_{c}$ and $F_{s}$ into the inequality, we get:\n\n$$1.25 \\leq \\mu_{s}mg$$\n\nSolving for $\\mu_{s}$, we get:\n\n$$\\mu_{s}"
